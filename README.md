# california-energy-forecasting
The goal of this study is to predict/simulate the relative percentages of energy types that California is powered by and calculate when California will be 100% powered by renewables. The purpose of this research is to identify the changing trends in the energy production of California in order to evaluate which types of energy sources should be further invested into and which energy sources should have reduced investment.

Types of Energy in this study: Coal, Geothermal, Hydroelectric Conventional, Natural Gas, Nuclear, Other, Other Biomass, Other Gases, Petroleum, Pumped Storage, Solar Thermal and Photovoltaic, Wind, Wood and Wood Derived Fuels
Note: For this study, coal, natural gas, other gases, petroleum, wood and wood derived fuels, and other are all considered fossil fuels, while geothermal, pumped storage, hydro, nuclear, other biomass, solar, and wind are all considered renewable energy sources. 

The dataset used is a list of the Annual Net Generation by State by Type of Producer by Energy Source for all 50 U.S. States and D.C. from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (a division of the U.S. Department of Energy), but only the total energy production information for CA from 1990 - 2020 is used for this study.
